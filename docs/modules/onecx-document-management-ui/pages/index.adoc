=== What is Document Management
Document management refers to the systematic process of capturing,
organizing, storing, and retrieving documents within an organization. It
involves the efficient handling of digital documents, ensuring secure
access, version control, collaboration based on TM-Forum standard
https://github.com/tmforum-apis/TMF667_Document[TMF 667].

With OneCX-Document-Management Software, you can streamline your
document management workflows, reduce manual efforts, and enhance
productivity. Whether it’s managing contracts, invoices, legal
documents, or any other form of digital content, OneCX Document
Management provides a centralized and user-friendly solution for
effectively managing your documents.

=== Overview
OneCX-Document-Management is a comprehensive solution for managing
documents in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that
consists of three main components which are explained in more detail in
the general documentation. Please refer to the following documentation
to learn more
https://onecx.github.io/docs/document-management/current/general/index.html[Document-Management
Documenation]. However, in this document we are only referring to one of
the three components, the OneCX-Document-Management-User-Interface (UI) of
OneCX-Document-Management.

The user interface (UI) for this document management component is designed to provide an intuitive
and user-friendly experience for managing documents in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus.

=== Getting Started
To start developing the OneCX Document Management User Interface, you need to
set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use
WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below.
If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the
requirements below.

==== Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17
* Maven build tool
* Git
* Docker + Docker Compose (Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
recommended)
* NodeJS

==== Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using
the following command:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/onecx-apps/onecx-document-management-ui.git
git clone https://github.com/onecx-apps/document-management-dev.git
----

The repository `onecx-document-management-ui` contains the source code of
the document management user interface. The repository
`document-management-dev` contains the necessary OneCX platform
dependencies and the docker-compose script required to run the OneCX
Document-Management-User-Interface on your local machine.

==== Update local DNS resolution
Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local 
development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses,
making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names
instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port,
we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is 
therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the
appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames.

*It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned.
Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically
generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted.*

===== Update Windows host file
Open the file `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` in your favorite
editor and add the following entries:

[source,bash]
----
127.0.0.1       pgadmin
127.0.0.1       postgresdb
127.0.0.1       keycloak-app
127.0.0.1       traefik
127.0.0.1       tkit-portal-app
127.0.0.1       tkit-portal-server
127.0.0.1       apm
127.0.0.1       wiremock
127.0.0.1       minio
127.0.0.1       onecx-document-management-ui
127.0.0.1       onecx-document-management-bff
127.0.0.1       onecx-document-management-svc
----

===== Update WSL host file
If needed, update the file `\etc\hosts` in `your` favorite linux editor and add the
same entries like above.

==== Starting OneCX dependencies
In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and
manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables
developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary
services and dependencies required by OneCX Document Management using a
simple configuration file.

[source,bash]
----
cd document-management-dev
docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app tkit-portal-server minio apm
----

* `traefik`: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments
that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined
rules and configurations.
* `postgresdb`: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database
management system. It is used as persistence layer for storing and
managing data in OneCX Document Management, providing reliability and
scalability.
* `pgadmin`: pgAdmin is an open-source administration and development
platform that offers a user-friendly graphical interface for managing
and interacting with the local PostgreSQL database.
* `keycloak`: Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management
system that simplifies authentication, authorization, and single sign-on
for web and mobile applications.
* `tkit-portal-server`: This micro-service is responsible mostly for
handling the logic of portals and their meunitems and user data and
settings.
* `minio`: We use MinIO as a facade or abstraction layer to decouple our
applications from the underlying cloud storage provider, providing
greater flexibility and allowing us to seamlessly switch between
different providers without changing our application code. It acts as a
unified interface, enabling us to interact with various cloud storage
systems using the standardized Amazon S3 API.
* `apm`: In this backend, user permissions are stored in a structured
manner and an endpoint is provided to import permissions via CSV files.
Each application can be assigned a set of roles and permissions, managed
through an association table in the APM database. Roles are assigned in
the Keycloak admin console and are retrieved from tokens, while strings
defined in APM are used to grant access to specific components or views
on the frontend.

==== Starting the OneCX Document Management User Interface
Navigate to the project directory and build the application using NPM:

[source,bash]
----
cd onecx-document-management-ui
npm install --force
----
Note: If you face any issues while npm install, try deleting the node_module folder and package-lock.json from the project.

Start the user interface:
[source,bash]
----
cd onecx-document-management-ui
npm start
----

==== Stopping OneCX dependencies
The `docker compose stop` command is used to stop the containers defined
in a Docker Compose file. It gracefully stops the running containers by
sending a stop signal, allowing them to perform any necessary cleanup
tasks before shutting down.

[source,bash]
----
cd onecx-document-management-dev
docker compose stop
----
